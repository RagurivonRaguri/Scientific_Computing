    ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
Question 1:
There are 8 functions, each having a variable of different datatypes(int, float, complex, set, dict, list). These variables are printed. Also the functions are called at the end of the file.

Question 2:
In this question I've created a structures function that accepts the user's input(It accepts integers). The number is then checked to see whether its even or odd. Next the number is iterated and appending all the numbers that are even or odd from 0 to a list(the list starts from 0 to the input number).The two lists are then printed.
PART 2
The variable num is initialized to 10.A while loop checks if num is greater than or equal to 1:If its true, it prints the value of num and decreases it by 1.If false, the loop stops.The print() ensures that the numbers are printed.The loop runs 10 times, decreasing num in each iteration. After the loop ends, a print() statement is used to move to the next line.

Question 3:
A function calculate_area() that calculates and returns the area of a circle, rectangle, or triangle based on the provided shape and dimensions. The math module is imported to use the constant math.pi for circle area calculations. The function takes three parameters: shape (a string indicating the type of shape), dimension1 (the radius for a circle or one side for other shapes), and dimension2 (used for rectangles and triangles but defaults to 0). If the shape is a circle, the function computes the area using the formula πr². For a rectangle, it multiplies dimension1 and dimension2, and for a triangle, it uses the formula ½ × base × height. If an invalid shape is provided, it returns an error message. The function is then tested with sample inputs for a circle (radius 5), a rectangle (10×4), a triangle (6×8), and an invalid shape ("hexagon"), demonstrating its functionality.
